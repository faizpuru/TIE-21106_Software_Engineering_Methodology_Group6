Repository for the project of TIE-21206_Software_Engineering_Methodology ( groupe6 Tensu).
For all members of this project, to be able to start using the repository ( doing "push" to the central server ), you HAVE to set up the SSH key on your computer;
To set up a local repository on your computer,import the already existing repository of gitlab on your computer.
 Then you have to put the ssh key on your computer so you have to go to /home/yourusername/.ssh/ and 
copy there the two files " id_rsa" and " id_rsa.pub" ( you can find them on gitlab in our project " TIE-21106_Software_Engineering_Methodology_Group6 " ).
